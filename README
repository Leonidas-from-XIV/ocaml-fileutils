libexif-ocaml.
--------------

This library is a wrapper around libexif ( http://libexif.sourceforge.net ).
It uses a different set of functions to correctly handle the type of each
exif entry. 

The type are separated in : string, byte, short, long, rational, srational,
undefined.

Please take a look at the documentation to see the different functions you
can use to extract the exif tag from a file.

Please report me any typing problem ( incoherent type for an entry ).
