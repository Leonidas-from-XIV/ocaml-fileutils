Must :

- use reparent in sysutil
- add more test to the test.ml file ( should have
  at least 200 test - only 133 at the time i am writing
  this line )

Wishlist :
- Create a libtar-ocaml, to handle the tar format
- Create a libzip-ocaml, to handle the ZIP compression
  format ( investigate on the other actual work on this
  theme ). This implementation should be 100% Ocaml code ( 
  it seems funny because zip require a great load of 
  computation but ocaml code is a kind of target for this 
  library ). Maybe, create an interface to make more easy the
  switch between a pure ocaml implementation and a possible
  C binding... 
- Investigate on the different UNIX command that should be 
  great to have... Maybe go and see if some interesting command
  exist on other OS...
