libexif-ocaml.
--------------

This library is a wrapper around libexif ( http://libexif.sourceforge.net ).
It uses a different set of functions to correctly handle the type of each
exif entry. 

The type are separated in : string, byte, short, long, rational, srational,
undefined.

Please take a look at the documentation to see the different functions you
can use to extract the exif tag from a file.

Please report me any typing problem ( incoherent type for an entry ).

Send bug report at submit@bugs.gallu.homelinux.org beginning with

Package: fileutils
Version: 0.2
Severity: { choose wishlist,normal,important }

and tell me your problem.

Information about filesystem
----------------------------

Well, i am not very acquainted with all filesystem syntax. I get information
about it here :
http://www.hk8.org/old_web/perl/sysadmin/ch02_02.htm

I also browse a bit the Anonymous CVS of ocaml.
