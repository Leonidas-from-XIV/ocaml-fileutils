ocaml-fileutils.
----------------

This library is intended to provide a basic interface to the most
common file and filename operation. It provides different filename
function : reduce, make_absolute, make_relative... It also enables
to manipulate real file : cp, mv, rm, touch...

It is separated in two modules : SysUtil and SysPath. The first 
one manipulate files ( real one ), the second one is made for 
manipulating abstract filename.

This library is still under developpement. I intend to make it as 
portable as possible. In other one, i welcome any bug report from
windows user, mac os user...

Information about filesystem

Well, i am not very acquainted with all filesystem syntax. I get information
about it here :

I also browse a bit the Anonymous CVS of ocaml.
