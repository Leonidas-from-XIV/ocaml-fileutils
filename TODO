Must :

- is_relative and is_implicit seems to be related, check if it is possible to 
  remove one of this function.
- make more easy to use FileUtil by including directly one default command directly
  into FileUtil and not in a submodule
- implement a basic glob function to replace the Str implementation (*, ?). 
- add more test to the test.ml file ( should have at least 200 test - only 133
  at the time I am writing this line )
- create a URI parser, in order to be able to adress different filesystem using
  the same string ( example file:/coucou/ to indicate the subdir coucou of the
  current dir )
- install
- pathchk


Wishlist :
- Create a libtar-ocaml, to handle the tar format
- Create a libzip-ocaml, to handle the ZIP compression format (investigate on
  the other actual work on this theme). Maybe, create an interface to make more
  easy the switch between a pure ocaml implementation and a possible
  C binding... 
- Investigate on the different UNIX command that should be great to have...
  Maybe go and see if some interesting command exist on other OS...
