ocaml-fileutils (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some weird comportement with reduce ( especially
    when trying to reduce filename which try to .. a root )
    and add the possibility to reduce relative filename
  * Rework on the way everything is made :
    * Support 4 different scheme of filename ( Unix ( the 
      native way ), MacOS, Win32, Cygwin )
    * Each scheme use a parser/lexer to decompose his 
      filename and a .ml to handle the whole discriminant 
      element of a specific scheme ( ie the way filename are
      decomposed and the way path like variable are decomposed )
    * All the operation are defined relatively to the 
      discriminant operation in a functorized module 
    * Each scheme produces a module from his discriminant element
      and from the generic operation. These modules are defined in
      SysPath.{UnixPath|Win32Path|CygwinPath|MacOSPath}.
    * Depending on the current environement one of the module above
      is the default binding for all the operation.
  * Add SysUtil which try to create some portable file operation :
    mv, cp, touch, mkdir, test, find. This module abandon any non
    cross platform operation and will never support it ( ie links for 
    example, won't be supported ).
  * This release is an alpha release. 0.2 will be the stable one.
